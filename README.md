# Blockchain-Based Commercial Lease Escrow

## Overview
This project implements a blockchain-based system for managing commercial lease agreements through smart contracts. It creates a transparent, secure, and automated process for handling commercial property leases, from initial verification to final condition assessment and deposit return.

## Core Components

### Property Verification Contract
- Validates legal ownership of commercial properties
- Maintains verifiable property records and condition history
- Stores property specifications, zoning information, and compliance status
- Links to legal documentation proving ownership rights

### Tenant Verification Contract
- Verifies potential tenants' financial qualifications and creditworthiness
- Manages business references and rental history
- Automates background checks through oracle integration
- Maintains privacy-preserving records of tenant verification

### Security Deposit Contract
- Manages escrowed funds throughout the lease term
- Implements transparent fund locking and release conditions
- Automates interest accrual according to local regulations
- Provides real-time visibility into deposit status for all parties

### Condition Assessment Contract
- Documents property condition at move-in and move-out
- Creates immutable record of property state with timestamp verification
- Manages dispute resolution process for condition disagreements
- Automatically triggers deposit release based on condition comparison

## Benefits
